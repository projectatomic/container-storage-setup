Configure a disk for test
=========================
- Add following line to file dss-test-config

  DEVS=/dev/sdb

  This tells test infrastructure to use disk /dev/sdb for tests. This disk
  should be unused.

Run Tests
=========
# ./run-tests.sh

By default /usr/bin/docker-storage-setup is used for testing. For using a
different binary, define environment variable DOCKER_STORAGE_SETUP.

DOCKER_STORAGE_SETUP=../docker-storage-setup.sh ./run-tests.sh
